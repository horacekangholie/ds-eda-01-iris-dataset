### EDA - Iris Dataset

#### About the dataset
The Iris dataset is a classic multivariate dataset introduced by Ronald Fisher, widely used in pattern recognition and machine learning. It contains 150 samples of iris flowers, divided equally among three species: setosa, versicolor, and virginica. Each sample includes four numerical features: `sepal length`, `sepal width`, `petal length`, and `petal width`, all measured in centimeters. These features are used to classify the species of the iris flower. The dataset is well-balanced, clean, and small, making it ideal for learning classification techniques and exploratory data analysis.

#### Histogram
Histograms are used in Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to visualize the distribution of a single numerical feature. They help you understand how values in a dataset are spread out, whether they are symmetrically distributed, skewed, or show signs of multimodal behavior (multiple peaks). Adding a KDE (Kernel Density Estimate) curve gives a smoothed version of the distribution, making patterns even clearer.
